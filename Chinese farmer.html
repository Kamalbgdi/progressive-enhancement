      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In nature, <strong class="good">Good</strong> &
          <strong class="bad">Evil</strong> do not exist. The Universe itself is
          neither <strong class="good">good</strong> nor
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong>, but a potential in permanent
          development.

      <p>In life, there are 4 types of people:</p>

          people who think the Internet is <strong class="good">good</strong>,
        </li>
        <li>

        <figcaption>Perspective from space</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
        rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
        cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
        no such thing as an issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists
        if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses
        don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
        changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t
        see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
        reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
        on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s
        fake.
      </p>

      <p>
        They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
        person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls
        from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
        the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
        like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you
        passively do it anyway.

      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
        <q class="villagers"
          >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.</q
        >
        The farmer said,
        <q class="farmer"
          >Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.</q
        >
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
        in the evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="villagers"
          >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!</q
        >
        The farmer again said,
        <q class="farmer"
          >Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.</q
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
        riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <q class="villagers"
          >Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong></q
        >, and the farmer responded,
        <q class="farmer"
          >Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.</q
        >
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
        into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said,
        <q class="villagers">Isn’t that <strong class="good">great</strong>!</q>
        Again, he said,
        <q class="farmer"
          >Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.</q
        >
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
          complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
          happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be
          the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
          consequences of good fortune.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="good">Good</strong> and
        <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are
        <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not
        <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big
        deal out of it...
